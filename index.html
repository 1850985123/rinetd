rinetd -- internet ``redirection server''
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">SYNOPSIS</font>
<p>
<code>/usr/sbin/rinetd</code>
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">VERSION</font>
<p>
Version 0.41, 2/11/1998.
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">WHERE TO GET</font>
<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.boutell.com/pub/boutell/rinetd/rinetd.tar.gz">By
anonymous FTP from ftp.boutell.com</a> in the subdirectory
<code>boutell/rinetd</code> as the file <code>rinetd.tar.gz</code>.
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">DESCRIPTION</font>
<p>
Redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another. rinetd
is a single-process server which handles any number of connections to
the address/port pairs specified in the file <code>/etc/rinetd.conf</code>. 
Since rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is
able to redirect a large number of connections without a severe
impact on the machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services
on machines inside an IP masquerading firewall.
<p>
rinetd should be launched at boot time, using the following syntax:
<p>
<code>/usr/sbin/rinetd</code>
<p>
The format of <code>/etc/rinetd.conf</code> is as follows:
<p>
<code>bindaddress bindport connectaddress connectport</code>
<p>
For example:
<p>
<code>206.125.69.81 80 10.1.1.2 80</code>
<p>
Would redirect all connections to port 80 of the "real" IP address
206.125.69.81, which could be a virtual interface, through
rinetd to port 80 of the address 10.1.1.2, which would typically 
be a machine on the inside of a firewall which has no
direct routing to the outside world.
<p>
Service names can be specified instead of port numbers. On most systems,
service names are defined in the file /etc/services.
<p>
Both IP addresses and hostnames are accepted for
bindaddress and connectaddress.
<p>
rinetd redirects TCP connections only. There is
no support for UDP.
<p>
The kill -1 signal (SIGHUP) can be used to cause rinetd
to reload its configuration file <strong>without</strong> interrupting existing
connections (this was added in version 0.4). Under Linux\(tm the process id 
is saved in the file \fI/var/run/rinetd.pid\fR
to facilitate the kill -HUP (added in version 0.41).
<p>
<font color="#FF8888" size="4">BUGS</font>
<p>
rinetd does not currently produce any log information. The
server redirected to is not able to identify the host the
client really came from. Sockets would theoretically lose
data when closed with <code>SO_LINGER</code> turned off, but in Linux
this is not the case (kernel source comments support this
belief on my part). On non-Linux platforms, alternate code
which uses a different trick to work around blocking close()
is provided, but this code is untested. The manpage
is sketchy.
